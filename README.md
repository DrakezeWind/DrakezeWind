# 👋 Hi — I’m Anthony (DrakezeWind)

This is my **secondary GitHub account**, primarily used as a **Windows-based development, testing, and learning environment**.

If you’re looking for my **portfolio, polished projects, and primary work**, please start here:
👉 [**@Drakeze**](https://github.com/Drakeze)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Account

This profile exists to support **active experimentation and growth**.

It is intentionally used for:
- Learning new tools, frameworks, and workflows  
- Testing ideas before they move into production  
- Building and refining systems incrementally  
- High-frequency commits and iteration  

You will likely see **more raw activity here** than on my main account—and that is by design.

## 🧠 How This Account Is Used

This account serves as my:
- Windows development environment  
- Learning and experimentation space  
- Staging ground for ideas and systems  
- Place where most “in-progress” work happens  

Projects here may evolve, change direction, or be archived as learning progresses.

## 🧱 Active Learning & Exploration Projects

- **Obsidian Vault**  
  My primary notes system for development, planning, learning, and content creation.

- **Growth Vault**  
  A dedicated repository for experimenting with new stacks, tools, and architectural ideas.

You may also see repositories related to:
- Courses and structured learning  
- Backend and frontend experiments  
- Tooling and environment setup  
- System design exploration  

This list will naturally change over time as projects are completed or consolidated.

---

## 🔁 Relationship to My Main Account

- This account focuses on **learning and iteration**
- My main account focuses on **presentation and finished work**

Work that matures here may later move into:
- My primary GitHub profile  
- Organizational repositories  
- Portfolio projects

## 🎓 Certifications (Supporting Learning)

![Coursera Certified](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coursera-Learner-blue?style=flat-square&logo=coursera)

Certifications support my learning, but most progress here is driven by hands-on experimentation.
